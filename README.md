Just walked out of The Woman in the Yard and I can’t decide if I'm bewildered or just mildly annoyed, or maybe that's just my stomach growling because I forgot to grab popcorn AGAIN. This  , man. Like, what kind of title is that even? Sounds like a mystery novel you'd find in a dusty attic. But there I was, glued to my seat, wondering if I stepped into the right theater or am I just a sucker for the dim lights and vague promises of catharsis.

The opening scene has this woman standing in the yard, just like the title promises—no false advertising there, at least. But she stands there like she's waiting for a bus that never comes. My immediate thought: this woman needs a chair, but then again, we barely got any seat cushioning ourselves, so maybe solidarity or whatever. 

>> Okay, so maybe it's art or something. There's, like, this intense stare-down with a garden gnome, and I'm thinking, wow, I'm having flashbacks to my Uncle Joe's lawn ornaments… Is this cinema or bizarre therapy?

There’s this recurring shot of a rusty swing creaking in the wind. If that wasn’t nature’s way of saying, “Run while you still can, buddy,” then I don’t know what is. The plot meanders like my cat when it’s trying to decide which window offers the best sun patch. Yet somehow that was the charm? Maybe. Like sipping certain teas that taste awful but the aftertaste sticks to you in some inconveniently satisfying way.

And the dialogue? Some lines were as perplexing as those auto-generated 𝘴𝘶𝘣𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘭𝘦s when you're 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 something in another language. The branches remember your name, or something like that—might have blown my mind or confused the heck outta me, can't tell. Call me weird, but now I just want to ask trees in the park if they knew me in a past life.

function womanInYard() {
  console.log(Waiting...);
}

> All in all, am I glad I saw it? Maybe. Could you pay me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again? Perhaps, depends if snacks are included. But seriously, if you ever get the chance, or if curiosity eats at you like a persistent mosquito, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Decide if the plot is sheer genius or just incredibly patient nonsense. My tired legs say thank you for the pause, but my mind is still, well, reflecting in the yard.
